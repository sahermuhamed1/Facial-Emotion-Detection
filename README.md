## Facial Emotion Detection using CNN and Streamlit real time webcam detection üé≠
### This project is aims to classify the facial emotion of the user using deep neural networks and deploy the model in a web application using streamlit, the user is able to either upload an imnage from its own device or to capture a live photo using the webcam

### In this project we used a lot of data science techniques:
- Image Preprocessing
- Build the CNN architcture from scratch
- Model Evaluation 
- Model Validation
- Deployment using Streamlit
